Summer Training at Oil India Limited, Jodhpur
Duration: 14th June to 16th July, 2025
Location: Oil India Limited, Jodhpur (Rajasthan Basin)

Overview
This repository contains documentation, report, and key learnings from my summer training at Oil India Limited (OIL), Jodhpur. The training provided hands-on exposure to various aspects of upstream oil and gas operations, including production optimization, reservoir assessment, drilling operations, and chemical applications in the industry.

Key Learnings
1. Production Department
Studied Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques, focusing on Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS).
Learned about artificial lift systems (e.g., ESP, Rod Pumps) for production optimization.
Analyzed production data to enhance well performance.

2. Rajasthan Basin Exploration
Explored block allocation strategies and their significance in hydrocarbon exploration.
Gained insights into seismic interpretation for subsurface mapping.
Studied well logging techniques (Gamma Ray, Resistivity, Sonic logs) for reservoir characterization.

3. Chemical Department
Understood the role of drilling mud additives (viscosifiers, lubricants, shale inhibitors).
Analyzed mud properties for wellbore stability and drilling efficiency.
Observed lab testing procedures for mud formulation.

4. Drilling Department
Learned about rig components (derrick, drill string, BOP) and their functions.
Studied well control techniques to prevent blowouts (kick detection, BOP operations).
Understood safety protocols and emergency response in drilling operations.
